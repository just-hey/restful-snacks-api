## RESTful Snack Api

An API built from scratch to practice with routes and error handling using the MVC architecture.
Has the following routes:
1.GET /snacks
1.GET /snacks/:id
1.POST /snacks
1.PUT /snacks/:id
1.DELETE /snacks/:id

Each snack has four (4) fields: id (string), name (string), qty (integer), imported (boolean)
